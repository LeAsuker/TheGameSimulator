[The Game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173090/the-game) is a card game built around discarding cards from a deck into multiple piles while following certain rules. The goal is to cooperatively discard all cards and not have any left over at the end. If a player has no possible move, all players lose.

I played this game with my friends yesterday and was interested in the probabilities and possible strategies. How important are each of the mechanics? How important is communication? How good of a solution is one that is locally best?

What I have found is that, assuming simplistic but good local play and no long-term strategy, the win rate is about 0.8%. 

Some of the rules are a bit simplified, as is the AI, but I intend to improve it when I have time. The simulator itself is very modular and can easily be edited to make the game more complicated, or to actually make it playable with real people.

A future plan of mine would be to make the game more engaging, add PVP elements, and port it to pygame with multiplayer.
